# TechnicalIndicators
This repository contains code used for Nik and Cameron's final project on Technical Indicators for COMP/MATH 112.

# SimulationEnv
The SimulationEnv contains all of the code necessary to reproduce the requesting of prices, RSI, STOCH values from
AlphaVantage, as well as the necessary code to wrangle, clean, and run non-optimized models on various stocks. It also
contains all of the code used to produce visualizations.

#Optimizer
This code is slightly less conducive to reproduction. On our first pass, we were unable to adapt the function that optimizes
to the SimulationEnv set up. Feel free to take a crack at it, if you have a few hours and you don't have anything else to do.
